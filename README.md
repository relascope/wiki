# Audio to Midi in Realtime (monophon)

Why?
-----
- compose with your voice
- play cello with your guitar
- ...

How?
-----
Dodo MIDI 2 is a VST3 plugin and works fine on some platforms, including Ardour on Linux. 

If you are using **Logic Pro**, you've got a problem, you have to work around:
- Use Kushview Element as a host for the VST3 plugin
- Configure Element for your preferred audio input
- Configure Element to use Logic Pro Virtual In as the MIDI Output Device

**Voila!**

Technical details
------------------
Logic Pro only supports Audio Unit plugins in version V2 and partially in V3. 

AU Plugins V2 do not support Audio input and MIDI Output. 

AU-VST-bridges don't work, cost money or may not work. 

For more complex projects
--------------------------
- Buy Vochlea Dubler 2
- use Melodyne (polyphonic, not realtime)
